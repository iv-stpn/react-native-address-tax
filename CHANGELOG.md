# react-address-tax

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`6ab00cb`](https://github.com/iv-stpn/react-address-tax/commit/6ab00cb9239f837d41c471a9cfec2b513982c6ee) Thanks [@iv-stpn](https://github.com/iv-stpn)! - Add the `react-address-tax/utils` subpath export

  Register `./utils` as a proper package entry point (ESM, CJS, and type declarations) so `import { isValidAddress } from "react-address-tax/utils"` resolves instead of failing with `Cannot find module 'react-address-tax/utils'` (ts2307). The entry exposes the library's component-free utility surface: address config/types, tax computation, and validation helpers.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`9cf2704`](https://github.com/iv-stpn/react-address-tax/commit/9cf27043e704d44e0c21cdf3b49f88935f794a40) Thanks [@iv-stpn](https://github.com/iv-stpn)! - Add isValidAddress and computeEffectiveFields utilities

  Export two new validation utilities from react-address-tax/utils:

  - `isValidAddress(value, mode, options?)` - Validates whether an address is valid for a given collection mode. Only the fields actually collected for that mode/country gate validity, so minimal mode can be valid with just a country (or country + region for regional countries like US/CA).

  - `computeEffectiveFields(mode, country, requireLevel1?)` - Returns the address fields that are actually collected and validated for a given mode and country. Useful for building custom forms or understanding validation requirements.

  These functions share the same logic used internally by AddressInput and AddressTaxInput components.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`e7fbf16`](https://github.com/iv-stpn/react-address-tax/commit/e7fbf1610ccae7e84b09581f59fda2c4cc0fbdd0) Thanks [@iv-stpn](https://github.com/iv-stpn)! - Expose `COUNTRY_CODES` (and the `CountryCode` type) at the `react-address-tax/codes` subpath so consumers can import the country code reference without pulling in the full component bundle.

- [`acf7228`](https://github.com/iv-stpn/react-address-tax/commit/acf72289aedaa0188c51e88d4b4670d5e5d06722) Thanks [@iv-stpn](https://github.com/iv-stpn)! - Add a `validationMode` prop (`"onType"` | `"onBlur"` | `"onSubmit"`) to `AddressInput` and `AddressTaxInput` controlling when field errors are surfaced. In `"onSubmit"` mode, call the component's ref `validate()` handle (exposed via the new `AddressInputHandle` type) to reveal errors.

  Validation now only gates on the fields actually collected for the active mode, so `minimal`/`regionMinimal` modes report valid as soon as the required field (country, or country + region) is provided.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`89f300d`](https://github.com/iv-stpn/react-address-tax/commit/89f300d4a1e29a0e674cd0295284a09989fea58a) Thanks [@iv-stpn](https://github.com/iv-stpn)! - Add `inline` mode to `AddressInput` and a `renderFields` transform for customizing field rendering.
